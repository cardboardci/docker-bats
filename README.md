# Docker image for Bats (Bash Automated Testing System)

Bats is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

A Bats test file is a Bash script with special syntax for defining test cases. Under the hood, each test case is just a function with a description.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "addition using bc" {
  result="$(echo 2+2 | bc)"
  [ "$result" -eq 4 ]
}

@test "addition using dc" {
  result="$(echo 2 2+p | dc)"
  [ "$result" -eq 4 ]
}
```

You can see the source repository [here](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/).

## Usage

You can run awscli to manage your AWS services.

```bash
aws iam list-users
aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.jpg"
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/xaccounts3access --role-session-name s3-access-example
```

### Pull latest image

```bash
docker pull cardboardci/awscli
```

### Test interactively

```bash
docker run -it cardboardci/awscli /bin/bash
```

### Run basic AWS command

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workspace cardboardci/awscli aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket/file.txt
```

### Run AWS CLI with custom profile

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -v "~/.aws/":/cardboardci/.aws/ cardboardci/awscli aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket/file.txt
```

### Continuous Integration Services

For each of the following services, you can see an example of this image in that environment:

* [CircleCI](usages/circleci)
* [GitHub Actions](usages/github)
* [GitLabCI](usages/gitlabci)
* [JenkinsFile](usages/jenkins)
* [TravisCI](usages/travisci)
* [Codeship](usages/codeship)

## Tagging Strategy

Every new release of the image includes three tags: version, date and `latest`. These tags can be described as such:

* `latest`: The most-recently released version of an image. (`cardboardci/awscli:latest`)
* `<version>`: The most-recently released version of an image for that version of the tool. (`cardboardci/awscli:1.0.0`)
* `<version-date>`: The version of the tool released on a specific date (`cardboarci/awscli:1.0.0-20190101`)

We recommend using the digest for the docker image, or pinning to the version-date tag. If you are unsure how to get the digest, you can retrieve it for any image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull cardboardci/awscli:latest
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' cardboardci/awscli:latest
```

## Fundamentals

All images in the CardboardCI namespace are built from [cardboardci/ci-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/cardboardci/ci-core). This image ensures that the base environment for every image is always up to date. The [common base image](https://cardboardci.jrbeverly.dev/core/) provides dependencies that are often used building and deploying software.

By having a common base, it means that each image is able to focus on providing the optimal tooling for each development workflow.
